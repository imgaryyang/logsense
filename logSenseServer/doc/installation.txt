To install the LogSense backend server, please do the following.

1.
Download Solr from the Apache Solr website and untar/unzip it. 

The Solr download url is:
http://lucene.apache.org/solr/downloads.html

2.
Make a copy of local.properties, name it yourName.properties and change the path
in there to the top level directory created by untarring Solr.

Let this toplevel directory be $SOLR_DIR 

3.
Installation: (caution: run with this ant target (forceCopy) only once, else it will wipe out your previous index.)

You will need ant 1.8.2+ for force copy to work.

From command line, execute this:
ant -Dbuild.env=yourName build.xml

If no build.env is specified, it will pick up local.properties file -- so you can edit it for your purposes, but don't check it back in :-)
 
If you run ant from eclipse on build.xml, specify -Dbuild.env=yourName as a VM argument, or use local.properties file.

4.
go to $SOLR_DIR/logSenseSolr and start the server:
java -jar start.jar

To increase jvm heap size, see start.sh in there. Or to run it as a cluster, see the other .sh files. Currently, those files have windows invisible chars, so instead of running them, type them in on a linux box. TODO: fix this windows/linux issue at Git level.


5.
To update the build:
run ant with target as copy. In Eclipse, you can select your current config with forceCopy as target (under External Tools Config), change the target, and save it. 

From command line:
ant -Dbuild.env=yourName copy

will run the target as copy in build.xml 

see http://ant.apache.org/manual/running.html for command line options.
