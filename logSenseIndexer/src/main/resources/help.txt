Options:

-d <dir> 
   will index all files in <dir>
   
   -d C:/logs/foo will take all log files from the directory C:/logs/foo/

-f <file> 
   will index <file>
   
    -f jetty-0.log.ohio-wwwssl40.yourdomain.com.123456.gz 

-i <ignoreFiles.txt>
    will ignore log files that are listed in the file ignoreFiles.txt

-p <processedFiles.txt>
   will add each file that is indexed into this file. 
    
   e.g., -i stress00.txt -p stress00.txt

   i.e., typically, you will have the same file for both -i and -p  so that the next time 
   you run the indexer, you start from where you left off.


-t <numRecords>
   when testing, you can limit the number of records per indexed file to this number.

   e.g., -t 10000

-u <serverUrl>
   e.g., http://yourmachine.yourdomain.com:8983
   
-e <env>
	e.g., feature1, qa2, staging, prod, etc

Most of these switches are designed to work with the -d <dir> flag. 
If you are testing with a single file (-f <file>), the -u flag will work, 
others will be ignored.
